### Document Object Model: 
Structured presentation of HTML documents. Allows JS to **access HTML elements** and style to manipulate them.
DOM is not only the part of JS, these are the parts of WEB API's (like a library) that we can access and use in our JS code.

**Event Listener:**
It listens to the event happening.
Like 
``` js
document.querySelector('.check').addEventListener('click',function(){});
```

Here the class **check** is selected then after listening to the **click** event the **function()** will tell what to do after
that click.
