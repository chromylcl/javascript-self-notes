* let *
Here the value of the variable can be changed or assigned different values.
For ex:-
`let age = 30;` 
`age = 31;`

** const ** 
Here the values of the value remains constant and does not change.
For ex:-
`const birth = 2006;`

** var ** 
Same role as let .
For ex:- 
`var job = 'programmer';`
`job = 'teacher' ;`

Then their must be a doubt that what is the difference betweent he let and var !
** In JavaScript, `let` is block-scoped and doesn’t allow re-declaration in the same scope, while `var` is function-scoped and allows re-declaration.
